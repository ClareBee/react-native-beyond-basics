# Splash Screen

A splash screen is what we show to users while the app is getting loaded. This can either be a full page image, or an image with a background.

## iOS Splash Screen

Open Xcode and find `LaunchScreen.storyboard` from the sidebar. This is the current launch screen. Let's update this to include our own image and background.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/splash-screen/xcode-start.png")}
  alt="XCode Storyboard"
/>

Open `Images.xcassets` and add a new Image Set called `SplashImage`.

Notice we need to add 3 versions of the image. Let's use the Ying Yang image from before:

<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/images/ying-yang@3x.png")} alt="Ying Yang image" />
<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/images/ying-yang@2x.png")} alt="Ying Yang image" />
<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/images/ying-yang.png")} alt="Ying Yang image" />

To add this to the Splash Screen, open the `LaunchScreen.storyboard` again and click on + on the top right corner of Xcode.

Search for `ImageView` and drag it to the center of your splash screen page.

Click on the `ImageView` and choose the Image asset you just creates from the right menu.

Click on the `View` on the left, and set the background to the blue of our main background image using the colour picker tool.

To ensure that the image is always centered in our container, choose the SplashImage from the tree view and click on the little bar chart icon on the bottom right of the toolbar, check "Center Horizontally in container" and "Center Vertically in container", and add both constraints.

Rebuild the app from Xcode.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/splash-screen/xcode-end.png")}
  alt="XCode Storyboard"
/>

## React Native Splash Screen

Despite our beautiful splash screen, you probably noticed that there is still a flash of white then the app first loads.

This is because the splash screen is hidden by the native code before React Native had finished loading the JavaScript code.

To prevent this flash, we can use [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen) to programmatically hide the splash screen when the app is actually ready.

Install the library with

```sh
yarn add react-native-splash-screen
```

or if using npm:

```sh
npm install react-native-splash-screen
```

Use the linking command to link the native dependencies:

```sh
npx react-native link react-native-splash-screen
```

Install native dependencies:

```sh
cd ios
pod install
```

## iOS

Open `AppDelegate.m` in Xcode and add the the code to display the splash screen:

```objective-c
#import "AppDelegate.h"

#import <React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h>
#import <React/RCTRootView.h>
#import "RNSplashScreen.h"  // here

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    // ...other code

    [RNSplashScreen show];  // here

    return YES;
}

@end
```

In `App.tsx`, hide the Splash Screen once the component has mounted:

```js
import SplashScreen from "react-native-splash-screen";

export const App: React.FC = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    SplashScreen.hide();
  }, []);
 ...
};

```

Rebuild the app from XCode to see the new splash screen in action.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/splash-screen/ios.png")}
  alt="iOS splash screen"
  width="500"
/>

## Android Splash Screen

First we need to create the splash image layout. Create an `android/app/src/main/res/layout` folder, and inside it a file called `launch_screen.xml`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical">
    <ImageView
        android:background="@color/splash_blue"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:scaleType="center"
        android:src="@drawable/launch_screen" />
</RelativeLayout>
```

To add the image, create a `android/app/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi` and save the Ying Yang image there with the name `launch_screen.png`.

<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/images/ying-yang@3x.png")} alt="Ying Yang image" />

Create a `app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml` file and add `primary_dark` and `splash_blue` colors:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <color name="primary_dark">#000000</color>
    <color name="splash_blue">#57C3EE</color>
</resources>
```

You can also preview the look and feel of the launch screen in Android Studio by opening the `launch_screen.xml` file

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/splash-screen/android-studio-layout.png")}
  alt="Android studio screen"
/>

To configure `react-native-splash-screen` for Android, install and link the library (if you haven't already) with

```sh
yarn add react-native-splash-screen
```

or if using npm:

```sh
npm install react-native-splash-screen
```

and the linking command to link the native dependencies:

```sh
npx react-native link react-native-splash-screen
```

Update the `MainActivity.java` to use `react-native-splash-screen` via the following changes:

```diff
+import android.os.Bundle;
+import org.devio.rn.splashscreen.SplashScreen;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
+   @Override
+    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
+        SplashScreen.show(this);  // here
+        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
+    }
}
```

Finally, rebuild the app from Android Studio.

<img
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/splash-screen/android.png")}
  alt="Android splash screen"
  width="500"
/>
