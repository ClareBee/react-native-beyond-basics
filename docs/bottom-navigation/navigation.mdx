# Navigation

Since React Native does not have navigation built in, we'll need to install a navigation library for ourselves. For this project, we'll be using [React Navigation v6](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/).

## Install the navigation library

```bash
yarn add @react-navigation/native react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
# or
npm install @react-navigation/native react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
```

### Android Only - additional native code

The react-native-screens package requires one additional configuration step to properly work on Android devices. Edit `MainActivity.java` file which is located in `android/app/src/main/java/moodtracker/MainActivity.java`

Add the following code to the body of MainActivity class:

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(null);
}
```

and make sure to add an import statement at the top of this file:

```java
import android.os.Bundle;
```

### iOS Only - install dependencies

Since this library includes native code, we'll also need to install the native dependencies:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

Finally, rebuild your iOS or android app:

```bash
yarn ios
# or
npm run ios


yarn android
# or
npm run android
```

## Add a bottom tab navigator

If you completed the into React Native course, then you should already be familiar with the Stack Navigator. In this project, we want to use tab-based navigation, so we're going to use the [Bottom Tab Navigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator) instead. We already installed `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` in the install step above, so we can already use it in our project.

The layout we're looking for looks like this:

<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/navigation/navigation.png")} alt="Navigation" />

First, let's create a new `src` directory at the root of your project. This is where all our code is going to live.

Next, let's create a `screens` directory inside `src`. This is for all of out screens.

In the `screens` directory, let's create two files for the `Home` and `History` tabs:

```tsx title="src/screens/Home.screen.tsx"
import * as React from "react";
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from "react-native";

export const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Home</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
  },
});
```

```tsx title="src/screens/History.screen.tsx"
import * as React from "react";
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from "react-native";

export const History: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>History</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
  },
});
```

Note that we're calling giving these files a filename with `screen.tsx` at the end. The `tsx` is the file extension for TypeScript, and the `screen` is just a convention to indicate that this is a screen file.

Next, let's create the Bottom Tabs Navigator. Add a new file to the `screens` directory:

```tsx title="src/screens/BottomTabs.navigator.tsx"
import * as React from "react";
import { createBottomTabNavigator } from "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs";
import { Home } from "./Home.screen";
import { History } from "./History.screen";

const BottomTabs = createBottomTabNavigator();

export const BottomTabsNavigator: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <BottomTabs.Navigator>
      <BottomTabs.Screen name="Home" component={Home} />
      <BottomTabs.Screen name="History" component={History} />
    </BottomTabs.Navigator>
  );
};
```

Now we'll need to wrap this in a navigation container. Let's create another file in the `screen` directory called `Root.navigator.tsx` and use it to wrap the `BottomTabsNavigator` in a `NavigationContainer`.

```tsx title="src/screens/Root.navigator.tsx"
import * as React from "react";
import { NavigationContainer } from "@react-navigation/native";
import { BottomTabsNavigator } from "./BottomTabs.navigator";

export const RootNavigator: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <BottomTabsNavigator />
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};
```

This might seems excessive at first, but as you start adding more screens and navigators to your project, you'll usually end up with a similar structure.

Finally we'll need to use use this navigator in out `App.tsx`. Open `App.tsx` and replace the contents with this:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import * as React from "react";
import { RootNavigator } from "./src/screens/Root.navigator";

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return <RootNavigator />;
};

export default App;
```
