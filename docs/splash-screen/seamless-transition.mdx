# Seamless Transition

Despite our beautiful splash screen, you probably noticed that there is still a flash of white then the app first loads.

This is because the splash screen is hidden by the native code before React Native had finished loading the JavaScript code.

To prevent this flash, we can use [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen) to programmatically hide the splash screen when the app is actually ready.

Install the library with

```bash
yarn add react-native-splash-screen
```

or if using npm:

```bash
npm install react-native-splash-screen
```

Use the linking command to link the native dependencies:

```bash
npx react-native link react-native-splash-screen
```

Install native dependencies:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

## iOS

Open `AppDelegate.m` in Xcode and add the the code to display the splash screen:

```objective-c
#import "AppDelegate.h"

#import <React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h>
#import <React/RCTRootView.h>
#import "RNSplashScreen.h"  // here

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    // ...other code

    [RNSplashScreen show];  // here

    return YES;
}

@end
```

In `App.tsx`, hide the Splash Screen once the component has mounted:

```js
import SplashScreen from "react-native-splash-screen";

export const App: React.FC = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    SplashScreen.hide();
  }, []);
 ...
};

```

Rebuild the app from XCode to see the new splash screen in action.

## Android

```bash
yarn add react-native-splash-screen
```

or if using npm:

```bash
npm install react-native-splash-screen
```

and the linking command to link the native dependencies:

```bash
npx react-native link react-native-splash-screen
```

Update the `MainActivity.java` to use `react-native-splash-screen` via the following changes:

```diff
+import android.os.Bundle;
+import org.devio.rn.splashscreen.SplashScreen;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
+   @Override
+    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
+        SplashScreen.show(this);  // here
+        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
+    }
}
```

Finally, rebuild the app from Android Studio.
