# Custom Fonts

If you're building apps for clients, they will more often than not have a custom font for you to use. Let's see how to add custom fonts to your app.

For free fonts to use in your app, check out [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

I've chosen [Kalam](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kalam) for this exercise. It is a Handwriting font, so it'll be really distinctive.

Feel free to choose a different font, but note that this font includes 3 styles: light, regular and bold. So far we have used "regular" and "bold" in the app so if you choose a different font, is must include both styles.

:::tip

One difficulty with fonts in React Native is that iOS and Android treat fonts differently. On Android, the `fontFamily` you use in your styles will just use the name of the file.

iOS apps however use the PostScript name of the font meaning that if your file name is different from the PostScript, your font will load on Android, but not on iOS. To check the PostScript name, double-click on the `.tff` file on a Mac

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('/img/custom-fonts/ios-alert.png')}
  alt="Install font alert"
  width="600"
/>

Choose install font, then choose your new font and click on the i (information) icon at the top:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('/img/custom-fonts/ios-postscript.png')}
  alt="Install font alert"
/>

You can see the PostScript name of the font at the top.

For React Native, always ensure your font files are named after the PostScript name to ensure they work on both iOS and Android.

:::

Once you've chosen your font, download it and unzip it.

In your `/assets` directory, create a new directory for `/fonts` and add your font file(s) in there.

Create a new file at at the root of your project and call it `react-native.config.js`.

Inside it, add a link to the fonts directory.

```js
module.exports = {
  assets: ['./assets/fonts'],
};
```

Now we'll need to link the project with

```bash
npx react-native link
```

If the linking has worked correctly, then you should be able to see the font files being copied over to both iOS and Android directories.

Finally, rebuild the app from XCode / Android Studio.

## Using custom fonts

Unlike the web, you won't be able to apply a font globally, so each individual `Text` element will need the font family style applied to it.

Let's start by adding the new fonts family to our `theme.ts`:

```ts title="src/theme.ts"
fontFamilyBold: 'Kalam-Bold',
fontFamilyRegular: 'Kalam-Regular',
fontFamilyLight: 'Kalam-Light',
```

To add the font family to the screen titles, use `headerTitleStyle` on `screenOptions` in `BottomTabs.navigator.tsx`.

```js
headerTitleStyle: { fontFamily: theme.fontFamilyBold },
```
