# Designing Your Icon

An App Icon is a unique image added to every mobile application. It's displayed on the App/Play store as well as the home screen.

App icons should be as simple as possible and contain no text so they would look as good as possible even on small screens.

## Design you app icon

Feel free to skip step and move on to "Add to iOS" or "Add to Android" if you're not interested in designing your own App Icon.

To design your app icon, open [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) ad create a new project.

First, use the Frame tool (third from the top) create a new Frame that's exactly `1024 x 1024px`.

Next, choose an image for your app icon. I have chosen this ["attitude" icon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/attitude_3174845) from FlatIcon.

Drag an drop your icon into Figma. Ensure it's centered within the square, and resize it so that it's big enough (but does not fill the whole square). I ended up with `700 x 700px`.

Next, choose a color for your background. I kept mine white with `#ffffff`.

When you're happy with your icon, select the whole frame from the left and hit "export" and export as `png`.
