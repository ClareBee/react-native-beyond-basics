# Mood Picker

To recap everything you already know about building React Native apps, and to set up our new app, let's build this mood picker on our home page.

## Requirements

1. Display 5 moods for the user to select from
2. Each mood should have an emoji and a description
3. Once selected, the mood is saved along with the current timestamp
4. Show the list of old moods under the selection box
5. The list should display most recent moods first.
