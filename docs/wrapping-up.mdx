# Wrapping Up

Yay, you've made it to the end of the course! üëè

## What you learned

- using TypeScript with React Native
- recap on core components and React Hooks
- bottom navigation
- JavaScript vs native libraries for React Native
- using React Context to store global app state
- persisting data across app launches
- rendering images locally and via url
- svg's in React Native
- adding custom fonts
- animations using LayoutAnimation
- bespoke animations using Reanimated 2
- adding app icons
- adding a splash screen
- data visualization

## Where to next?

We have really only scraped the surface when it comes to animations in React Native. Now that you have the fundamentals, you could try your hand at some of these animations:

- group the items in the history tab by day and create a drawer layout
- create a component to fade or zoom in when an image loaded via url has finished loading
- animated header for a scrollable page

Something we didn't really touch on were haptic feedback (vibration) and sounds. Haptic feedback in particular can add a lot to an app's user experience!

- use [react-native-haptic-feedback](https://github.com/junina-de/react-native-haptic-feedback) to add a vibration effect when the user selects a mood
- [react-native-sound](https://github.com/zmxv/react-native-sound) to play a soundtrack in your app that the user can turn on and off

We also only added one [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/native) chart in our app, but there are so many more charts available! Get creative, try visualizing your data in a different kind of chart, perhaps a bar chart that shows has a bar for each type of mood on each day?

## Wrap Up

Thanks so much for taking my course. I hope you found it informative and helpful on your React Native journey!

Best of luck on your nest project! üöÄ
