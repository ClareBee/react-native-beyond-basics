# Mood Picker

In the next couple of sections we'll be building the UI for our mood picker.

We do this using basic UI elements: `View`, `Text` and `Pressable` and the `useState` and `useCallback` React hooks. We'll style the components using inline styles with `StyleSheet` and we'll install a JavaScript library - `date-fns` - for formatting the date.

If you fancy testing your knowledge, feel free to implement the UI based on this design, without looking at the next sections.
