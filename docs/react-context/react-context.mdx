# React Context

You'll notice that currently our both the mood picker and the moods list are on the same page. We'd like the list of past moods to be in the history tab instead. The question is - how do we share state between the two tabs? As the screens are adjacent to each other in the component tree, we can't pass them down as props.

The solution therefore must involve storing the state _outside_ of either component. There are several ways to do this, [redux](https://redux.js.org/) being a popular choice.

:::tip
If you are going to use Redux for your own project, check out [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start) which lets you use redux with minimal boilerplate. It's also fully typed with TypeScript!

However, we will explore an alternative approach that's build into React and therefore also available in React Native - that is [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

React Context consists of two parts: a provider and a consumer.

A Provider is a top level component that stores the data.

A Consumer can consume all data within the Provider from anywhere in the component tree without having to pass the data down as props.

This means that if we wrap our whole app in a Provider, then the data within the provider will be available from anywhere in our app.

:::danger
For production use, React Context is great for storing top level state - theme, application state etc. However you should be aware that a change context will cause a re-render in all the components that use it. You can have multiple React Contexts in your app, and for performance reasons it's best to keep them small and single-purpose.

## Create a Provider

To start using context, we'll first need to create a provider.

Add a new file in your `/src` directory called `App.provider.tsx`.

A new context is created using the `createContext` function where we pass in the default value for the context.

A Provider is a component that wraps component tree that should have access to context. The object passed in as the `value` to the provider will contain all the data that the child components will have access to.

```tsx title="src/App.provider.tsx"
import React from 'react';

type AppContextType = {
  greeting: string;
};

const defaultValue = {
  greeting: '',
};

const AppContext = React.createContext<AppContextType>(defaultValue);

export const AppProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={{ greeting: 'Hello' }}>
      {children}
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

## Wrap your app in a context provider

Remember that context is only available from the components that are nested within the context provider.

In our case, let's put our context provider as high as possible, and wrap our whole app in `App.tsx`:

```diff title="src/App.tsx"
import * as React from "react";
import { NavigationContainer } from "@react-navigation/native";
import { RootNavigator } from "./screens/Root.navigator";
+import { AppProvider } from "./App.provider";


export const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
+    <AppProvider>
        <NavigationContainer>
          <RootNavigator />
        </NavigationContainer>
+    </AppProvider>
  );
};
```

## Access the context

To access your context, you can use `useContext` hook. It's usually handy to expose the context hook separately from your provider. Add the following to your `App.provider.tsx`:

```js
export const useAppContext = () => React.useContext(AppContext);
```

Now you'll be able to use the same context values from anywhere in your app, e.g. `History.screen.tsx`:

```diff title="src/screens/History.screen.tsx"
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native';
+import { useAppContext } from '../App.provider';


export const History: React.FC = () => {
+  const appContext = useAppContext();

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>History</Text>
+      <Text>{appContext.greeting}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});
```
