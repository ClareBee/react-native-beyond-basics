# Pie Chart

We have a whole tab for analytics, but it's empty!

For this task, use [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/native/) to create a pie chart for the moods.

:::tip
Although you can definitely do this with plain React Native, you may find it handy to install [lodash](https://lodash.com/) and use the [groupBy](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#groupBy) method to group the moods by emoji.
