# Reanimated 2

If you need more fine-grained control over your animations, you'll have to configure them yourself.

Now, React Native comes with an [Animated](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated) API which you can use out of the box, _however_ that's not what we're going to use for this course.

For this course we will instead use [Reanimated 2](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs).

:::note Story time!
Reanimated 1 was originally built to address some performance issues of React Native's built in API, and it was designed to mimic the Animated API exactly.

The recently released Reanimated 2 however is the real game changer: it completely moves away from Animated's unintuitive declarative API and exposes a series of hooks you can use to animate your components instead. It is much less code and much easier to understand if you're already familiar with React and React hooks!

Personally, I only started liking animations in React Native after I started using Reanimated 2. I hope you will as well!

:::

## Install Reanimated 2

Follow the [installation docs](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation) to install Reanimated 2. At the time of writing this is still in beta so we'll have to use the `@next` tag, but the documentation site will have the latest instructions for the future.

### Install Reanimated

First, install the reanimated library from npm:

```bash
yarn add react-native-reanimated@2.3.0-beta.1
# or
npm install yarn add react-native-reanimated@2.3.0-beta.1
```

Add the Reanimated plugin to your `babel.config.js`:

```diff title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
+  plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],
};

```

Finally, restart the metro bundler by stopping the JavaScript process and running `yarn start` or `npm run start` again.

### Android only

1. Turn on Hermes engine by editing `android/app/build.gradle`

```
project.ext.react = [
  enableHermes: true // <- here | clean and rebuild if changing
]
```

2. Plug Reanimated in `MainApplication.java`

```
import com.facebook.react.bridge.JSIModulePackage; // <- add
import com.swmansion.reanimated.ReanimatedJSIModulePackage; // <- add
...
private final ReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost = new ReactNativeHost(this) {
...

    @Override
    protected String getJSMainModuleName() {
      return "index";
    }

    @Override
    protected JSIModulePackage getJSIModulePackage() {
      return new ReanimatedJSIModulePackage(); // <- add
    }
  };
...
```

### iOS only

Install the native dependencies:

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### Rebuild the app

Finally, rebuild the app from XCode / Android Studio / CLI

Make sure you also restart your metro bundler by closing the process and running:

```bash
yarn start --reset-cache
# or
npm run start --reset-cache
```

### Debugging

If you see an error like this:

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('/img/animation/error.png')}
  alt="Error after installing library"
  width="500"
/>

this means the babel plugin isn't added correctly.

1. Ensure you've added `react-native-reanimated/plugin` to your `babel.config.js`
2. Ensure it's the last one in the plugins list
3. Restart the metro bundler without cache

```bash
yarn start --reset-cache
# or
npm run start --reset-cache
```

## `useAnimatedStyle` and `withTiming`

Reanimated 2 has a lot of interesting features, but some of the ones you'll end up using the most often are [useAnimatedStyle](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/api/hooks/useAnimatedStyle) and [withTiming](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/api/animations/withTiming).

`useAnimatedStyle` will let you apply an animated style to a component, and `withTiming` is one of the transition functions that starts a time-based animation. Best to see this by example! Let's open our `MoodPicker` and update it so the "Choose" button shows a disabled state then no option is selected.

First, we'll need to convert our `Pressable` into a component what can accept animated styles.

:::danger
Only Reanimated components can use animated styles! If your animation isn't working, make sure the component using the style is a Reanimated component.
:::

```ts
import Reanimated from 'react-native-reanimated';

const ReanimatedPressable = Reanimated.createAnimatedComponent(Pressable);
```

Next, let's define an animated style that will set the button opacity to 0.5 when the button is disabled and 1 otherwise:

```tsx
import Reanimated, { useAnimatedStyle } from 'react-native-reanimated';

const buttonStyle = useAnimatedStyle(
  () => ({
    opacity: selectedMood ? 1 : 0.5,
  }),
  [selectedMood]
);
```

:::danger
Don't forget to add `selectedMood` to the dependency array for the `useAnimatedStyle` hook.
:::

Let's add this as the second array in our button styles:

```tsx
-      <Pressable style={styles.button} onPress={handleSelect}>
+      <ReanimatedPressable
+        style={[styles.button, buttonStyle]}
+        onPress={handleSelect}>
         <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Choose</Text>
-      </Pressable>
+      </ReanimatedPressable>
```

Now this toggles between opacity `1` and `0.5`, but doesn't animate. This is where we pull in `withTiming` - this will start the animation to gradually move from `0.5` to `1` and vice versa. All we need to do is wrap the new value in a `withTiming`:

```tsx
import { withTiming } from 'react-native-reanimated';

const buttonStyle = useAnimatedStyle(
  () => ({
    opacity: selectedMood ? withTiming(1) : withTiming(0.5),
  }),
  [selectedMood]
);
```

We can animate more than one style at a time. Let's also animate the scale so that the button is smaller then it's disabled:

```tsx
const buttonStyle = useAnimatedStyle(
  () => ({
    opacity: selectedMood ? withTiming(1) : withTiming(0.5),
    transform: [{ scale: selectedMood ? withTiming(1) : 0.8 }],
  }),
  [selectedMood]
);
```

:::danger
At the time of writing, there is a bug on Android where applying `withTiming(0.8)` will cause the app to crash on load, which is why we're not applying the transition to the initial value. This will be fixed in future versions of Reanimated 2.
